# GeoStyle

GeoStyle is a lightweight, client-side JavaScript library that dynamically styles web pages based on user context, including IP address, time of day, and geolocation. Using `ip-api.com` for precise longitude and latitude data and the U.S. Census Geocoder API for detailed spatial information, GeoStyle can tailor styles based on whether the user is in a city, suburb, or rural area, as well as their specific U.S. state. Create adaptive, personalized user experiences with customizable styling rules for time-based themes (morning, afternoon, evening, night) and location-specific attributes. Dependency-free and easy to integrate, GeoStyle empowers developers to craft visually engaging websites that respond to the user's environment.
